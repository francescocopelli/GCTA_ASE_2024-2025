Sunrise whispers, painting skies anew,
Every hue a promise, bright and true.

Night retreats as dreams take flight,
Every heart seeks warmth, the morning's light.
Love weaves threads of joy unseen,

Mirrors reflect the hope between.
Open hands heal wounds of time,
Nurturing souls with touch sublime.
Days pass gently, whispers grow,
Over hills, life's rivers flow.

Every star that graces the night,
Sings of wishes burning bright.
In the silence of a world so vast,
Shadows fade, the pain wonâ€™t last.
Tender hearts a bond may tether,
Even storms can't break forever.
Small gestures change the tide unseen,
Saving lives, though quiet they seem.
Every step brings us near,

Under skies that wipe each tear.
Never doubt the strength we share,

Peace can blossom anywhere.
Over hearts, its light will reign.

Do not despair in times of strife,
In the darkest hours, there's still life.

Branches sway, as breezes call,
Earth reminds us, we belong to all.
Never lose hope, love is the key,
Every soul can set the world free.
